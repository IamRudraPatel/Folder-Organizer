# 📁 Folder Organizer
This Python script organizes files within a folder by sorting them into specific categories like images, videos, audio files, documents, and more.

## 🛠️ Features
The script scans a specified folder ('input_folder') and identifies the type of each file by its extension. It then organizes these files into respective subfolders within the same 'input_folder'.

Currently, the script categorizes files based on their extensions into the following categories:

• 🖼️ Images Files (.jpg, .png, .gif, .bmp, etc.)                                                                             
• 🎥 Videos Files (.mp4, .avi, .mov, .mkv, etc.)                                                                             
• 🎵 Audio Files(.mp3, .wav, .m4a, .ogg, etc.)                                                                             
• 📄 Documents Files (.pdf, .docx, .csv, .pptx, etc.)                                                                        
• 💻 Code Files (.py, .java, .cpp, .js, .html, .css, etc.)                                                                   
• 📊 Data Files (.txt, .json, .db, .sql, etc.)                                                                             
• 🗃️ Archives Files (.zip, .rar, .tar.gz, .7z, etc.)                                                                         
• 📦 Others Files (Backup Files, Font Files, Excecutable Files, System/Config Files)
